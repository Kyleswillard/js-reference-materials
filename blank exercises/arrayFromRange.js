// In this exercise you will need to take to inputs (numbers) and output an array of numbers
// for example if you call arrayFromRange(1, 10)
// Output expectation would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
// Another example would be if you have arrayFromRange(-10, 1)
// Output expectation would be [-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1]

// Included: Functions, loops.
// Please note while this is a fairly easy exercise for experience programmers, it can be tricky.
// Ensure that you keep your code 'DRY' and clean.
