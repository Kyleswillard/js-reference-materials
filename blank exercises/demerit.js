// In this exercise you will be graded on your driving. 
// You will input your speed in KPH, and for every 5 miles above the speed limit you get a 'Point'
// If you hit 12 points your license is suspended. 
// You need to console.log ok if speed == speed limit, under 5 miles over the speed limit.
// Console.log points above that. 
// At 12 points please console.log('License Suspended')
